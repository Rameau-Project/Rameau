# Rameau

RAMEAU is a musicological analysis system, written in C++ and still under development. It can help the music analyst to examine pieces of music regarding structural and statistical aspects and identify various diagnostically relevant features. The application can help to compare pieces of music with respect to their basic harmonic structure by mapping successive vertical sets of notes (i.e., successive simultaneous chords) as 2-tuples of pitch classes (pcs according to Forte 1973) in fingerprint grid diagram.

In addition, it allows the creation of alignments from the sequences of 2-tuples of consecutive vertical pitch classes (pcs), from which cladograms can be created using third-party phylogenetic programs.
